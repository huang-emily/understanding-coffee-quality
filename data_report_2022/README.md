# Data Analytics Study: Understanding Coffe Quality
This repository contains files from a project that was done during my time at UC Berkeley's 
Master of Information and Data Science program for Statistics, specifically for the 
Data Science course in the Spring 2022 term.

This project sought to understand what makes coffee "good quality" by applying a 
linear regression model with the the Coffee Quality Instituteâ€™s database.

## Tools used 
- **Programming**: R
- **Visualizations**: R (ggplot2)
- **Code Management**: R Studio

## Proposed Question

The project asked us to act as a data science team from a corporation and to answer a question 
that was asked by the corporation's executives. 

In this instance, we acted as the data science team from Starbucks and were tasked to 
answer whether taste was an indicator of coffee quality to due to poor feedback about taste. 

## About the Dataset 

The dataset used in this study is from the [Coffee Quality Institute](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/coffee_ratings.csv).

The dataset was curated by certified coffee drinkers and contains 1339 observations of 
different coffees and their attributes like aroma, flavor, body, altitude, uniformity, country of origin, and etc. 

## Findings

Based on the study, the taste of a coffee is actually a strong indicator of coffee quality 
which means customers may be indicating something significant about the drinks that the 
company is providing to customers. 

Because the dataset was based on the Coffee Quality Institute's dataset rather than 
Starbucks' dataset, there needs to be an additional study to understand where the feedback 
is coming from. It is important to understand whether only a subset of all drinks or all 
Starbucks drinks are creating this response for customers.
